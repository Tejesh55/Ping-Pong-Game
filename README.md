# Ping-Pong-Game
Hello Friends, I am Tejesh. Basically the project is nothing but a ping pong game developed using kivy and 
programming language used is python. The game is nothing but a ball is bouncing randomly and the players 
Should hit the ball with the bars provided. If a player misses the ball to hit then he will lose
a point. The main.py file contains the python code of the project and pong.kv file contains the kivy code
that indicates the ball and bars components. Before running the project dont forget install kivy in your 
Computer.

Note :- If you are using this program anywhere don't Forget to give credits for me.

//// Thank You Guys, Love Programming \\\\
